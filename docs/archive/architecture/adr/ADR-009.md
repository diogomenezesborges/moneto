# ADR-009 — AI as an Advisor, Not a Core System Dependency

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

AI can significantly enhance personal finance products by:

- summarizing complex situations
- explaining patterns in natural language
- providing reflective guidance

However, over-reliance on AI introduces:

- operational cost
- unpredictability
- opaque logic
- tight coupling between core functionality and external services

The system must remain **fully functional, trustworthy, and low-cost**
without any AI involvement.

## Decision

AI SHALL be used as an **advisory and explanatory layer**, not as a core system dependency.

The system must:

- operate correctly without AI
- produce all authoritative data through deterministic logic
- use AI only to interpret, narrate, or explain pre-computed facts

AI is optional, event-driven, and intentionally rare.

## Scope of AI Usage

AI MAY be used for:

- summarizing behavioral patterns (Habits)
- explaining Net Worth changes in natural language
- contextualizing investment performance
- phrasing suggestions or reflective questions
- narrating “what changed and why” over a period

AI MUST NOT be required for:

- transaction correctness
- categorization accuracy
- financial calculations
- net worth computation
- habit detection
- data integrity

## Design Principles

- AI consumes aggregates and deltas, not raw transactions
- AI outputs are non-authoritative and explainable
- AI suggestions are advisory, not prescriptive
- AI usage is triggered by meaningful events, not continuous polling

When AI is unavailable or disabled, the system degrades gracefully.

## Cost Control Principles

- AI calls are infrequent (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or on-demand)
- AI prompts are short and structured
- Deterministic computation precedes AI narration
- AI is never used where rules or heuristics suffice

The system optimizes for **near-zero operational cost** by default.

## Relationship to Other Domains

- Habits and Net Worth generate signals deterministically
- AI may explain or summarize these signals
- AI does not mutate Money Flow, Habits, or Net Worth data
- AI suggestions may inform Next Moves, but never execute actions

AI behaves as a **quiet advisor**, not an always-on assistant.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Predictable system behavior
- Strong cost control
- High user trust
- Safe foundation for future advisory features
- No vendor lock-in at the core logic level

### Trade-offs

- AI feels intentionally subtle
- Some insights require more upfront product logic
- Less “wow effect” in early interactions
