# ADR-000 — Architecture Decision Record Index

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Purpose

This document provides an index and high-level summary of all Architecture
Decision Records (ADRs) for the project.

These ADRs document **product intent, architectural principles, and UX invariants**.
They are intended to guide future development and prevent accidental drift
toward short-term, feature-driven decisions.

Changes that conflict with these ADRs must be made consciously and explicitly.

## ADR Index

### Foundations

- **ADR-001 — Purpose: Build a Personal & Couple Wealth System (Not an Expense Tracker)**  
  Defines the product as a long-term wealth progression system, not a bookkeeping tool.

- **ADR-002 — Money Movements as the Primary Source of Financial Truth**  
  Establishes money movements as factual truth and distinguishes external movements
  from internal transfers.

- **ADR-003 — Financial Meaning Is Derived, Not Stored**  
  States that facts are persisted, while habits, insights, and recommendations are
  always derived.

### Product Structure & Experience

- **ADR-004 — Product Architecture Organized by User Journey (Not Feature Lists)**  
  Organizes the application around the user’s financial journey:
  Money Flow → Habits → Net Worth → Choices → Next Moves.

- **ADR-005 — Separation of Money Flow and Cash Flow**  
  Separates editable transaction views from aggregated, reflective cash-flow analysis.

- **ADR-006 — Habits as the Primary Behavioral Insight Layer**  
  Replaces dashboards with a behavioral insight layer focused on patterns and trends.

### Wealth & Decision Modeling

- **ADR-007 — Net Worth Modeled as Periodic Snapshots**  
  Models financial position using periodic snapshots instead of real-time valuation.

- **ADR-008 — Investment Performance Anchored to Purchase-Time Context**  
  Evaluates investments based on the context at the time of the decision, not hindsight.

---

### AI & System Safety

- **ADR-009 — AI as an Advisor, Not a Core System Dependency**  
  Constrains AI to an optional, explanatory role with strict cost and reliability limits.

- **ADR-010 — Internal Transfers Are First-Class, Neutral Money Movements**  
  Defines transfers as neutral movements that do not affect net worth or spending.

- **ADR-011 — Non-Shaming, Confidence-Building Financial UX Principles**  
  Establishes emotional safety and non-judgmental UX as a system invariant.

## Usage Guidelines

- ADRs express **intent**, not implementation detail
- New features must align with existing ADRs or introduce a new ADR
- Conflicts between ADRs must be resolved explicitly
- Revisions should prefer additive clarification over destructive rewrites
