# ADR-008 — Investment Performance Anchored to Purchase-Time Context

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Most personal finance tools evaluate investments using current performance only
(e.g. total return, current value vs invested value).

This approach ignores the **decision context at purchase time** and introduces
hindsight bias, making it difficult for users to learn from past choices.

Users need to understand whether an investment decision was reasonable
_given what was known at the time_, not whether it outperformed all alternatives
in retrospect.

## Decision

The system SHALL evaluate investment performance relative to the **purchase-time context**.

Investment analysis is anchored to:

- purchase date
- amount invested
- asset acquired
- reasonable benchmark alternatives available at that time

Performance answers the question:

> “Given what I chose then, was this a good decision?”

## Scope of Investment Evaluation

Investment evaluation MAY include:

- absolute return since purchase
- relative performance versus benchmarks
- opportunity cost versus alternatives
- time-weighted or money-weighted metrics (where applicable)

Investment evaluation does NOT:

- rely on hindsight optimization
- compare unrelated time periods
- imply that alternative outcomes were obvious or guaranteed

## Design Principles

- Evaluation favors learning over judgment
- Comparisons are contextual, not absolute
- Benchmarks are reasonable and explainable
- Precision is less important than direction

Investment performance is presented as **feedback**, not as a score.

## Relationship to Other Domains

- Investment purchases originate from Money Flow as transfers
- Investment value contributes to Net Worth snapshots
- Performance evaluation lives in the Choices domain
- Habits may surface consistency or discipline signals

Investment evaluation does not mutate Money Flow or Net Worth data.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduces hindsight bias
- Encourages reflective decision-making
- Makes opportunity cost visible
- Supports long-term investing behavior
- Aligns with non-shaming financial UX principles

### Trade-offs

- Requires benchmark reference data
- More complex than naive ROI calculations
- Some assets may require manual valuation
