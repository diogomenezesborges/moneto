# ADR-010 — Internal Transfers Are First-Class, Neutral Money Movements

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Users often move money between accounts they own, such as:

- checking → savings
- checking → broker
- personal → shared account
- cash → bank account

Many finance systems:

- ignore these movements
- or misclassify them as expenses or income

This leads to:

- inflated spending figures
- distorted habits
- incorrect cash-flow analysis
- impossible net worth reconciliation
- loss of user trust

Correct handling of internal transfers is essential for a system that aims to
support long-term wealth tracking.

## Decision

The system SHALL model **internal transfers** as **first-class money movements**
that are **economically neutral**.

Internal transfers represent a change in **location or allocation**, not a change
in ownership or wealth.

## Definition of Internal Transfer

An internal transfer is a money movement where:

- both the source and destination accounts are owned by the user
- no economic gain or loss occurs
- net worth remains unchanged

Examples:

- bank account → savings account
- bank account → investment account
- personal account → joint account

## Modeling Rules

- Internal transfers are explicitly marked (e.g. `movementType = transfer`)
- Transfers are recorded even if no category applies
- Transfers are not categorized
- Transfers do not affect net worth
- Transfers are included in Money Flow views
- Transfers are excluded from Cash Flow analysis by default

Where applicable, linked debit/credit movements MAY share a common identifier
to support reconciliation.

## Design Principles

- Transfers must explain balance changes without implying spending
- Destination accounts imply intent (e.g. saving, investing)
- Categories must not be overloaded to represent transfers
- Users must be able to recognize transfers easily and calmly

## Relationship to Other Domains

- **Money Flow**  
  Transfers are visible, neutral, and editable

- **Habits**  
  Transfers may inform behavioral patterns (e.g. saving consistency) but are not
  treated as expenses

- **Cash Flow**  
  Transfers are excluded to avoid distortion

- **Net Worth**  
  Transfers move value between assets but do not change total position

- **Choices**  
  Transfers to investment accounts may anchor future performance evaluation

## Consequences

### Positive

- Prevents double-counting and false expense inflation
- Enables accurate Net Worth modeling
- Improves clarity and trust
- Supports couples and shared accounts cleanly
- Aligns with wealth-focused product goals

### Trade-offs

- Requires explicit modeling and migration of historical data
- Adds complexity to import and reconciliation logic
- Some user education required
