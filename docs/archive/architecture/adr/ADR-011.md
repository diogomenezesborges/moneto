# ADR-011 — Non-Shaming, Confidence-Building Financial UX Principles

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Money is an emotionally charged topic.  
Many personal finance applications unintentionally create feelings of:

- guilt
- shame
- anxiety
- inadequacy

This often happens through:

- judgmental language
- aggressive alerts
- red/green moral framing
- dashboards that emphasize failure over progress

Such experiences reduce trust, discourage engagement, and work directly against
long-term financial improvement.

## Decision

The system SHALL follow **non-shaming, confidence-building UX principles**
across all user-facing experiences.

The product must make users feel:

- safe to be imperfect
- capable of learning
- in control of their journey

The system is designed to **support growth**, not to score or judge.

## Core UX Principles

### Language

- Use descriptive, not judgmental language
- Prefer neutral observations over moral framing
- Avoid words that imply failure or blame

### Presentation

- Avoid red/green success/failure framing where possible
- Prefer trends and direction over absolute thresholds
- Show progress over time, not just shortfalls

### Interaction

- Allow correction without penalty
- Avoid irreversible actions
- Never force immediate decisions

### Feedback

- Frame insights as observations, not verdicts
- Encourage reflection rather than reaction
- Provide context before recommendation

## Relationship to Other Domains

- **Money Flow**  
  Errors and corrections are normal and expected

- **Habits**  
  Patterns are observed, not judged

- **Net Worth**  
  Position is shown without comparison or ranking

- **Choices**  
  Decisions are evaluated in context, not scored

- **Next Moves / AI Advisor**  
  Suggestions are optional, phrased as questions or considerations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Higher long-term engagement
- Increased user trust
- Better learning outcomes
- Strong alignment with couples and shared finances
- Differentiation from traditional finance tools

### Trade-offs

- Less aggressive or “gamified” feedback
- Slower perceived gratification
- Requires more careful copywriting and UX review
