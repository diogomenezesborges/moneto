# ADR-001 — Purpose: Build a Personal & Couple Wealth System (Not an Expense Tracker)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Most personal finance applications focus on:

- expense tracking
- categorization
- dashboards

These approaches optimize for **accounting accuracy**, not **financial progress**.

The primary users of this system are:

- individuals
- couples

who want to **improve financial confidence, alignment, and long-term wealth**, starting from zero knowledge if needed.

## Decision

The system SHALL be designed as a **wealth progression system**, not merely an expense tracker.

Core product principles:

- Help users understand themselves financially
- Reduce anxiety and shame around money
- Emphasize long-term position over short-term noise
- Support both individual and shared (couple) finances

Expense tracking is treated as a **means**, not an end.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Product decisions are guided by user growth, not feature parity
- UX prioritizes clarity and comfort
- Enables long-term extensions (investments, net worth, guidance)

### Trade-offs

- Some traditional “finance app” features may be intentionally omitted
- Requires stronger product thinking, not just technical execution
