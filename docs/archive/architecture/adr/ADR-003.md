# ADR-003 — Financial Meaning Is Derived, Not Stored

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Financial systems often persist interpreted meaning directly in storage
(e.g. habits, trends, conclusions, or recommendations).

This approach leads to:

- stale or outdated insights
- hard-to-reverse assumptions
- loss of user trust
- difficulty evolving product logic

Financial understanding evolves over time as more data is collected and
interpretation logic improves.

## Decision

The system SHALL persist **facts**, not **conclusions**.

### Persisted Facts

- Money movements (transactions)
- Movement type (external vs internal transfer)
- Assets and liabilities
- Periodic net-worth snapshots
- User decisions (e.g. investment purchases)
- Explicit user inputs and corrections

### Derived Meaning

The following are **derived at read time**, not stored as authoritative truth:

- habits and behavioral patterns
- trends and drifts
- warnings and signals
- recommendations and suggestions
- advisory narratives (AI-assisted or deterministic)

Derived meaning is computed from persisted facts using current logic.

## Design Principles

- Facts must be stable and reversible
- Interpretation must be explainable
- Derived meaning must tolerate imperfect data
- Changes in logic must not corrupt historical facts

Interpretation layers are expected to evolve as the product matures.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Insights improve as logic evolves
- No irreversible conclusions are stored
- Easier to iterate on product behavior
- Increased user trust through transparency
- Safe foundation for advisory features

### Trade-offs

- Requires computation at read time
- More attention needed for performance and caching
- Additional care in explaining insights to users
