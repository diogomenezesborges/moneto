# ADR-005 — Separation of Money Flow and Cash Flow

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

The system exposes both:

- transaction-level money movements
- aggregated views of how money circulates (e.g. Sankey diagrams)

In many financial applications these concepts are conflated, causing:

- confusion between editing and analysis
- misleading insights
- accidental double-counting
- emotional overload for users

Users need both **detail** and **structure**, but at different moments and with different expectations.

## Decision

The system SHALL explicitly separate **Money Flow** and **Cash Flow** as distinct but related concepts.

### Money Flow

Money Flow represents **concrete money movements**.

Characteristics:

- Transaction-level detail
- Editable and correctable
- Includes external movements and internal transfers
- Focused on _what moved_

Money Flow is the primary place where users:

- review imports
- fix mistakes
- apply categories and rules
- build trust in the data

### Cash Flow

Cash Flow represents **aggregated circulation of money**.

Characteristics:

- Derived from Money Flow
- Non-editable
- Excludes internal transfers by default
- Focused on _how money behaves_

Cash Flow exists as a **lens**, not as a source of truth.

## Relationship Between the Two

- Money Flow is authoritative and mutable
- Cash Flow is interpretative and derived
- Users may drill down from Cash Flow into Money Flow
- Users do not edit data from Cash Flow views

## Design Principles

- Editing and reflection must not happen in the same context
- Aggregate views should never surprise users with unexplained numbers
- Internal transfers must not distort Cash Flow analysis
- Cash Flow visuals prioritize structure over precision

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear mental model for users
- Reduced risk of misinterpretation
- Improved emotional safety when reviewing finances
- Strong foundation for Habits and Net Worth domains

### Trade-offs

- Requires careful navigation and drill-down design
- Some users may initially expect to edit data from aggregate views
