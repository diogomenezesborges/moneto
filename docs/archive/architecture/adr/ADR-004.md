# ADR-004 — Product Architecture Organized by User Journey (Not Feature Lists)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Early versions of the application evolved around feature-based groupings such as:

- Transactions
- Categories
- Rules
- Stats

While technically convenient, this structure led to:

- A past-focused experience
- Dashboard-driven usage
- Weak guidance for financial improvement
- Poor onboarding for users with low financial literacy

The product goal is to help users (individuals and couples) **progress from financial uncertainty to confidence and long-term wealth**, not merely to inspect data.

## Decision

The application SHALL be structured around a **user journey**, not around isolated features.

Product domains are defined by the **questions the user is trying to answer**, forming a progressive narrative:

1. **Money Flow**  
   _What money moved, and is it correct?_
   - Transactions
   - Categories
   - Rules
   - Corrections
   - Internal transfers

2. **Habits**  
   _What patterns does this reveal about us?_
   - Behavioral trends
   - Spending drift
   - Consistency and volatility
   - Lifestyle signals

3. **Net Worth**  
   _Where do we stand right now?_
   - Assets and liabilities
   - Periodic snapshots
   - Allocation and position

4. **Choices**  
   _Were our past decisions good ones?_
   - Investment performance since purchase
   - Comparison with reasonable alternatives
   - Opportunity cost

5. **Next Moves**  
   _What should we consider doing next?_
   - Suggestions and nudges
   - Warnings and signals
   - Optional AI-assisted explanations

Technical features (e.g. categorization, imports, visualization) are **subordinate** to these domains and may be reused across them.

## Design Principles

- The journey is progressive; users are not expected to start at the end
- Earlier domains build trust; later domains support reflection and action
- Editing is limited to early domains (e.g. Money Flow)
- Later domains are primarily interpretative and advisory

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear narrative for users
- Reduced cognitive overload
- Easier onboarding for beginners
- Strong foundation for habit formation and wealth growth
- Aligns product structure with long-term goals

### Trade-offs

- Requires refactoring feature-based pages
- Some components span multiple domains
- Developers must reason in terms of user intent, not just data
