# ADR-002 — Money Movements as the Primary Source of Financial Truth

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Financial data originates from **money movements**:

- income
- expenses
- transfers

These movements are:

- imperfect
- messy
- frequently corrected by users

Rigid models or real-time assumptions introduce fragility, misclassification, and user anxiety.  
Ignoring or collapsing different types of movements (e.g. treating transfers as expenses) leads to incorrect insights and loss of trust.

## Decision

The system SHALL treat **money movements (transactions)** as the primary source of financial truth.

Money movements represent **what moved**, not **what it means**.

Key principles:

- All balance-affecting movements are recorded
- Movements are always editable
- Interpretation (categories, habits, insights) is layered on top
- Corrections are expected and normal

Categories, rules, and automation exist to **support clarity**, not to enforce correctness.

## Classification of Money Movements

Not all money movements represent economic gain or loss.

The system explicitly distinguishes between:

### External Movements

Money entering or leaving the user’s financial universe.

Examples:

- salary
- refunds
- groceries
- rent
- taxes

External movements MAY:

- be categorized
- affect habits
- appear in cash-flow analysis
- affect net worth

### Internal Transfers

Money moving between accounts owned by the user.

Examples:

- checking → savings
- checking → broker
- personal → shared account
- cash → bank account

Internal transfers:

- Are first-class money movements
- Do NOT represent expenses or income
- Are NOT categorized
- Do NOT affect net worth
- Exist to explain balance changes and allocation

The meaning of a transfer is derived from its **source and destination accounts**, not from categories.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Prevents false expense inflation
- Enables correct net worth modeling
- Improves trust in insights and habits
- Supports couples and shared finances cleanly
- Aligns with long-term wealth tracking

### Trade-offs

- Requires explicit modeling of movement type
- Slightly more complexity in import and reconciliation logic
- Some historical data may require reclassification
