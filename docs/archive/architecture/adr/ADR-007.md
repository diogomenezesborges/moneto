# ADR-007 — Net Worth Modeled as Periodic Snapshots

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Tracking transactions and cash flow provides insight into financial behavior,
but it does not describe **financial position**.

Wealth is defined by what a user **owns** and **owes** at a given moment in time,
not solely by the money that moved to reach that point.

Real-time valuation of all assets introduces unnecessary complexity, cost,
and false precision—especially for illiquid or manually managed assets
(e.g. PPRs, real estate, private investments).

## Decision

The system SHALL model **Net Worth** using **periodic snapshots** rather than
continuous real-time valuation.

A snapshot represents the user’s financial position at a specific point in time.

Key principles:

- Net Worth is state, not flow
- Snapshots are authoritative for their point in time
- Consistency is prioritized over precision
- Net Worth is independent of transaction history

## Scope of Net Worth

Net Worth snapshots MAY include:

- cash and bank balances
- investment accounts (ETFs, PPRs, crypto, etc.)
- real estate and other assets
- liabilities (mortgages, loans, credit)

Net Worth snapshots do NOT:

- include individual transactions
- reflect internal transfers as gains or losses
- require real-time market prices

## Design Principles

- Snapshots are taken periodically (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or manually)
- Assets and liabilities are first-class concepts
- Allocation and composition matter more than short-term fluctuation
- Historical snapshots are immutable once recorded

## Relationship to Other Domains

- Money Flow explains _how_ the position changed
- Habits explains _why_ the position evolves
- Net Worth shows _where the user stands_
- Choices evaluates _how decisions affected position_

Net Worth does not depend on Cash Flow visualizations and does not allow editing
of transaction data.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear and calm view of financial position
- Enables long-term wealth tracking
- Works with illiquid and manually tracked assets
- Low operational and API cost
- Strong foundation for investment evaluation

### Trade-offs

- Less granular short-term valuation
- Some manual input required
- Users must understand snapshot cadence
