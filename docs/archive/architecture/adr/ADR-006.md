# ADR-006 — Habits as the Primary Behavioral Insight Layer

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-24

## Context

Traditional personal finance applications rely heavily on dashboards and charts
(e.g. spending by category, monthly totals, averages).

While visually appealing, these approaches often:

- encourage passive observation instead of reflection
- create an illusion of control
- overwhelm users with numbers
- fail to drive meaningful behavior change

The product aims to help users **understand their financial behavior**, not merely inspect historical data.

## Decision

The system SHALL introduce **Habits** as a dedicated domain for behavioral insight.

Habits is the primary layer where:

- patterns are revealed
- trends are interpreted
- behaviors are named and explained

Habits derives meaning from **Money Flow** but does not allow data mutation.

## Scope of Habits

Habits focuses on **behavioral patterns**, including but not limited to:

- spending drift over time
- fixed vs flexible cost ratios
- consistency of saving and investing
- volatility of discretionary spending
- lifestyle creep relative to income changes

Habits does NOT:

- display raw transactions
- allow editing or categorization
- function as a generic statistics dashboard

## Design Principles

- Habits is non-editable and reflective
- Insights are presented one at a time
- Language precedes visualization
- Patterns are framed descriptively, not judgmentally
- Users may drill down to Money Flow for context, not correction

## Relationship to Other Domains

- Habits consumes Money Flow data
- Habits informs Net Worth interpretation
- Habits may trigger signals for Next Moves
- Habits never acts as a source of truth

## Consequences

### Positive

- Encourages self-awareness over micromanagement
- Reduces anxiety and shame around money
- Supports long-term behavior change
- Provides a strong foundation for advisory features

### Trade-offs

- Requires curated insight logic instead of generic charts
- Fewer “metrics” visible at once by design
