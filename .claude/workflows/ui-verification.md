# Server & Dev Environment

**Development server:**

```bash
npm run dev  # Next.js dev server on localhost:3000
```

**Verification checklist for UI tasks:**

1. ✅ Start dev server if not already running
2. ✅ Make changes to code
3. ✅ Check dev server console for errors
4. ✅ Verify changes are visible in browser (localhost:3000)
5. ✅ Test both light mode and dark mode (if UI change)
6. ✅ Only mark task as done after visual verification

**Never mark UI tasks complete without browser verification.**
